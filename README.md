# AzGlue, a secure API gateway for IT Glue
This project has been forked from [Kelvin Tegelaar](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar)'s repo hosted on [KelvinTegelaar/AzGlue](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/AzGlue) and originally posted to his (fantasic) blog [cyberdrain.com](https://www.cyberdrain.com/documenting-with-powershell-handling-it-glue-api-security-and-rate-limiting/).

The first release will maintain backwards compatibilty with Kelvin's existing gateway and public scripts. 

Once this is complete, I will be implmenting some new features which would require existing scripts to be reworked.

### Goals for first release:
- [x] Allow local dev, testing and deployment with VSCode's [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions).
- [x] Prevent misconfigured gateways from accepting empty API keys.
- [x] Restrict returned data from the /organizations endpoint to honor OrgId whitelisting.
- [x] Allow clients to post new passwords without allowing them to retrieve existing passwords.
- [x] Allow whitelisting specific API endpoints.
- [x] When relaying requests, allow per-endpoint filtering and validation of:
  - [x] Supported HTTP methods (POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE).
  - [x] Query string paramaters.
  - [x] Payload data sent to IT Glue.
  - [x] Payload data returned to the client.
- [x] Move IT Glue API key to Azure Key Vault.
- [ ] Set up default whitelisted-endpoints.yml file to work with Kelvin Tegelaar's existing scripts.

### Goals for second release:
- [ ] Per-client API keys  
- [ ] System to only returned data relevant to the specific PC making the request.

### Progress setting up whitelisted-endpoints.yml defaults:
  - [x] IT-Glue-ADDS-Documentation.ps1
  - [ ] IT-Glue-ADGroups-Documentation.ps1
  - [ ] IT-Glue-AzureADSettings-Documentation.ps1
  - [x] IT-glue-BitLocker-Documentation.ps1
  - [x] ITGlue-Device-AuditLog.ps1
  - [x] ITGlue-DeviceSync.ps1
  - [x] IT-Glue-FileSharePermissions-Documentation.ps1
  - [x] IT-Glue-HyperV-Documentation.ps1
  - [ ] IT-Glue-intuneApplication-Documentation.ps1
  - [x] IT-Glue-LAPSAlternative-Documentation.ps1
  - [ ] IT-Glue-Network-Documentation.ps1
  - [ ] IT-Glue-O365-MailboxPermissions-Documentation.ps1
  - [ ] IT-Glue-O365-Teams-Documentation.ps1
  - [ ] IT-Glue-O365-UsageReports-Documentation.ps1
  - [ ] IT-Glue-Server-Documentation.ps1
  - [x] IT-Glue-SQL-Documentation.ps1
  - [x] IT-Glue-Unifi-Documentation.ps1

### Basic setup
1. Install the [Azure Functions extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) for VS Code.
2. Copy the local.settings.json.example file, and remove the .example extension. 
3. Populate the AzAPIKey, ITGlueAPIKey & ITGlueURI environmental variables here.
4. Copy OrgList.csv.example and remove the .example extension.
5. Update to match your environment.
6. Right click on the "AzGluePS" direction, and select "open with Code"
7. Open the "run.ps1" file and press F5. 
8. Test it locally using the "http://localhost:7071/api/${functionName}?ResourceURI=" URI.
9. Open the Azure tab on the left, open Functions, click the "Deploy to Function App.." button to create/deploy the app in Azure.
11. Open the App Service in the Azure Portal, and enable a system managed identity from Settings > Identity. 
10. Set up application settings:
    1. Open the Azure portal, open your App Service, open Configuration > Application settings.
    2. Add AzAPIKey, ITGlueAPIKey & ITGlueURI environmental variables here. 
    3. If you've got a Key Vault, you can authorise the system managed identity and provide access to the key through the Application settings [using this process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references)

### Basic usage:
Once the gateway is deployed to Azure Functions, you can use the standard IT Glue Powershell module to query it.
```PowerShell
Import-Module ITGlueAPI
$functionSite = "ITGlueAzureGateway"
$functionName = "AzGlueForwarder"
$functionToken = "long_random_password_generated_by_Azure"

# note that the base Uri should end with the = sign.
Add-ITGlueBaseUri "https://${functionSite}.azurewebsites.net/api/${functionName}?code=${functionToken}&ResourceURI="
Add-ITGlueApiKey "random_password_saved_in_functions_environmental_variables"

Get-ITGluePasswords -organization_id 1234
```

While it's running locally you can use something like this for the Base URI:
```PowerShell
$functionName = "AzGlueForwarder"
Add-ITGlueBaseUri "http://localhost:7071/api/${functionName}?ResourceURI="
```

After my previous blogs the comment I’ve received most was worries about the API key. If they key gets stolen you’re giving away the keys to the castle. The API has no limitations and with a leaked key all your documentation could be download. I’ve been discussing this issue with IT-Glue for some time but haven’t gotten a real solution yet. This has forced me to look for a solution myself. I gave myself some requirements for the solution.

- The solution needed to be simple and accessible for everyone.
- The solution needed to have multiple levels of authentication; an API key, IP whitelisting, and organization whitelisting.
- The solution needed to block requests for all passwords/files/etc for all organisations.
- The solution needed to allow some form of handling of the API rate limiting, e.g. repeating a request if it was rate limited.
- The solution needed to be able to used, without adapting any scripts (except URLs and API codes.)
- So after some research I decided to use an Azure Function for this. I’ve blogged about Azure Functions before, but the main reason is that running this function in the consumption model will cost us nothing (or next to nothing if you are an extremely heavy user.)
